# Random Office GIF
A simple application that shows you a random Office GIF from Giphy on every page load. Refresh until you find the right one and click to copy to the markdown for fast pasting into Github!

## ... But why?
Good question, but why not!? In all seriousness though, I mostly created this because I like The Office and find myself reacting with Office GIFs in pull requests quite often. It became annoying to me to keep searching for the right GIF and so a project was born. It was also a nice chance to try out Svelte.
